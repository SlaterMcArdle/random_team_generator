  ## Description
  Our class project needs groups for the second project. This randomly assigns groups of three and puts any remainders into a random group. It logs the result to the console.

  ## Installation Instructions
  Download from Github.

  ## Usage Instructions
  Run with npm start.

  ## Contribution Instructions
  It could use the ability to store the class list separately, and update the classlist from within the generator. It could also use a more graphical interface.

  ## Testing Instructions
  There's no input, so not much to test.
